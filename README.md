To run an application , you should have docker installed , 
than launch it from project root directory with a command :

At endpoints which used with Kafka : update , 
create bets pass items separated by one space , 
following data types ; 

# Ex.:
    col - id , name , date 
    val - 1 , “John” , 1928281

I tested queries in the 'Postman' app;
